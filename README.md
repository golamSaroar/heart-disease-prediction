## Using Support Vector Machines to Predict Heart Disease

The goal of this project is to build a Support Vector Machine for predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease using scikit-learn and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel. The Cleveland dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for this task.

The notebook mainly contains the following sections:

- importing libraries
- loading and exploring the dataset
- handling missing data
- formatting the data (one-hot encoding, centering and scaling)
- building a preliminary support vector machine
- optimizing parameters with cross validation
- building, evaluating, drawing, and interpreting the final support vector machine

Please have a look at the notebook [here](heart-disease-prediction) or open it on [Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Q9xpVE1yQXBSKt4YmS001vqn1fa6l0O/view?usp=sharing).
